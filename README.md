# WebToolsPracticeField

This project is a website to practice things learned in the "DÃ©boguage Web" cursus in Apside Academy.
It uses the jumbotron demonstration from [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/jumbotron/?#](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/examples/jumbotron/?#)

##Warning
This code is used as an exercise to use devtools. It is full of bad practices and the code is voluntarly complexified in order to use the tools.
